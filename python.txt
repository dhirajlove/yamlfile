python programming
features of python
1. feature of language are nothing but services or facilities provided by language developer and used by programmers for developing real time application.
2. python programming provides 11 features they are
   1. simple
   2. freeware and open source
   3. platform independent language
   4. dynamically typed prgramming language
   5. interpreted programming language ( source code ----> byte)
   6. high level programming language
   7. both procedural and object oriented programming language
             a. classes
             b. objects
             c. data encapsulation
             d. data abstraction
             e. polymorphism
             f. inheritance
             g. message passing
   8. robust (strong)
   9. extensible 
  10. embedded
  11. supports third party APIs such as Numpy, Pandas, matlab lib scipy and scikit
  

======================================================================================================
 
* 1 simple 
   
    python is the one of simple programming language bcoz of of 3 imp technical features
    they are
    
1 libraries in python are called as Modules
import calender= importing libraries

module is collection of functions

python programming provides rich set of APIs so that python programmer can reuse the pre defined code without writing our code
 defination of API (application programming Interface)

=> An API is a collection of Modules
a modules is collection of attributes , funtions and class names . examples calenders, math , cmath, random,... etc


* 2 garbage collector facilities provided in python
 garbage collector eliminate empty space. it is inbuilt features of python
it improves performance of python based program
garbage collector is running in the background of regular python program
garbage collector take care of memory management

in english= 1. alphabet 2. words 3. grammer
in python=  1. accurate concept 2. APIs --modules 3. syntaxes

python provides user friendly syntax so thaty we can develop error free


interpreted programming language
in general we have two types of programming language they are
1. compiler basewd programming language(c,c++, java,c#.net..etc)
2. interpreter based programming language(python,8086)

when we executr python program ,two process takes place internally
a. compilation process
b. execution process

python virtual machine(PVM)
pvm is one of the program in python software and whose role is to read line by line of byte
code and converted into machine level language

****************DAY 3**************************

platform independent language
python is one of the indepemndent language 


data types

all data types of c programming have different memory allocation
it is dependent on os
